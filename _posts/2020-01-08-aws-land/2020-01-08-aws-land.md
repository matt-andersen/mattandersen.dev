I managed to complete the *AWS Concepts* course today. This was basically a crash course, but it still allowed me to get a nice overview of what AWS offers. Below are a few notes from today:

- VPC: Virtual Private Cloud. In my time on the service desk, VPC referred to a virtual computer e.g. a VMware Horizon zero client. So initially I assumed this is what it meant. But it refers to your own "carved out" section of AWS where you can store files and computing resources and allow/restrict certain access to them.

- EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud - a computer but on the cloud 😲! I've had a bit of experience using an EC2 to host a WordPress site. Web hosting seems to be one of the more common uses for EC2s.

- RDS: Relational Database Service - a database platform used for storing things such as customer account info and as an inventory catalogue.

- S3: Simple Storage Service - storage platform for AWS. Avoid using EC2 for long-term storage instead use an S3 bucket.

[This diagram](aws-architecture.png) (via Linux Academy) outlines how all these pieces could come together.

As a sidenote, I'm restructuring my course outline and will post an update on that tomorrow.
