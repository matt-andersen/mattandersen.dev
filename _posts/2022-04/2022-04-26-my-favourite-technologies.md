I have a list of my favourite technologies on my [Tech](/tech) page.

These are technologies I have used that I _also_ enjoy working with. This is
somewhat inspired by the Stack Overflow Developer
Survey: <https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021>.

Originally, I came up with a big list of technologies I have used and liked.
Then from that, I tried to get it down to a dozen or so. My selections are sort
of arbitrary and based purely on feeling.

There are a lot of things I haven't used before that I would like to use. So
some of these items on the list might be dethroned in the future. Also, this
isn't an authoritative list, it is all personal preference. ðŸ™‚

## 1. Python

I like Python for the very reasons it is popular. Such as its simple syntax,
readability, support, and versatility. I am a bit of a sucker for _The Zen of
Python_ as well.

I also have experience using Java, JavaScript, and a tiny bit of C#. And
although it isn't an apples to apples comparison, I find Python the most
pleasurable to work with. There are some other languages I would like to try in
the future though. Like WASM with Rust or a functional language like Clojure.

## 2. Bash

Bash is similar to Python in the sense of how versatile it is. There is still a
lot I have to learn about Bash, but it continues to come in handy for me with
deployment pipelines and working on Linux machines.

## 3. HTML/CSS

I believe my first foray into coding was via Java. But my second was making
websites with HTML and CSS. So I guess it has a special place in my heart.

I don't have much experience with any of the frontend libraries. But I think I
want to learn some more frontend stuff soon as I have an app or two I would like
to make.

Regardless, I always enjoy hacking together a little static site, writing my own
CSS, trying to follow best practices for my HTML, etc. My knowledge of HTML/CSS
has come in handy many times, and I imagine it will continue to do so in the
future.

## 4. Redis

Using Redis as a form of quick storage has saved me many times. Running it as a
container makes it even easier. It just works. I don't have much of a preference
for any particular NoSQL and relational databases.

## 5. GitHub

I use their repository hosting, container registry, issues, actions, and
Dependabot alerts. Their products are all very low friction. So I can spend more
time worrying about my code. Comparatively, I find something like the Atlassian
products very bloated by comparison but probably makes more sense in an
enterprise setting. Trello is always nice though.

As for cloud/hosting platforms, most of my experience is with AWS and a tiny bit
of GCP. I don't have a preference where I feel obliged to use either. For
example, I recently used Cloudflare to host and serve a static site. Whereas
originally, I planned to use AWS with S3 and CloudFront. But Cloudflare was
great for my use case and exceeded all my expectations.

## 6. FastAPI

FastAPI has great documentation and is very intuitive. It feels like the "web
framework built for human beings." I can do stuff in FastAPI at a fraction of
the time it would have taken me to do it in Spring.

## 7. Black

Black is a very awesome and handy Python library for formatting code. Besides
the line length, which I keep at 90, I roll with the defaults because they just
make sense. With Prettier, for example, some formatting doesn't look very pretty
to me. But I don't want to have to play around with customising things myself. I
always put Black in my projects, even if it is just something hacky.

## 8. Git

A must-have for any developer. Even if I have no plans on putting my code
anywhere. I still make a Git repo to keep track of my work and organise it.

## 9. Containers

There isn't much to say here that hasn't already been said a hundred times.
Personally though, I find containers fascinating on a technical level.
Understanding containers has helped me understand Linux better and vice-versa.

I don't have any preference for a particular orchestrator, as I have only used
Kubernetes.

As a side note, I still think VMs are great, especially for development on
Windows. And Vagrant is very handy for handling VMs.

## 10. Trivy

Trivy provides valuable feedback on when I write my Dockerfiles. It can also be
used for Kubernetes manifests, in your CI/CD pipelines, and for scanning your
dependencies. It is flexible whilst still being lightweight enough to run as
binary or as a container.

## 11. PyCharm

I know VSCode is a popular alternative, but I have been using PyCharm for as
long as I have been writing Python. Every time I try VSCode, I quickly come back
to PyCharm (or other JetBrains IDEs). Everything just works, I don't have to
fiddle around with a dozen different plugins, it is well-made software, and I am
a happy paying customer.

## 12. Linux

Like containers, there isn't much to say that hasn't already been said. Linux is
also something I find fascinating on a technical level.
