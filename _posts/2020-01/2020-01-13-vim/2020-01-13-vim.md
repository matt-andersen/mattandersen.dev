Today was my first look at Vim and I can see why it is so powerful. I'll
probably add a course on Vim at some point but for the time being I don't want
to get too side-tracked. The rest of today's focus was a mix of scripting,
hardware, and networking.

- Shell scripting:

  - `#!/bin/bash`: Defines the interpreter to be used by the shell script and
    is placed at the top of the script file.

  - `PATH=$PATH:<directory>`: Appends a new directory to the PATH variable.
    This allows you to run scripts stored in this directory regardless of your
    current working directory.

  - `chmod +x <script>`: Sets permissions for a script to be executable.

  - `head/tail -n 100`: Outputs the first (head) or the last (tail) 100 lines
    of a file. Without the `n` option, this command will output the first/last
    10 lines.

- Hardware and logging:

  - `free -h`: Shows the RAM usage, the `-h` option denotes a human readable
    format.

  - `lscpu`: Displays CPU information.

  - `uname -r`: Displays the kernel version.

  - `top`: Shows every running process and their associated ID. These
    processes are stored in folders via a 'virtual file system' at `/proc/`.

  - `dmesg`: Prints out a message buffer for the kernel. Typically used for
    troubleshooting hardware issues.

  - `journalctl`: Used in Fedora to display messages in the system journal.

  - `ps -u <user> | wc -l`: Shows how many processes are running as a given
    user.

- Networking:

  - `host`: Translates hostname into IP address.

  - `/etc/hosts/`: The hosts file, used for statically mapping IP addresses to
    hostnames.

  - `dig`: Similar to `host` but it contains additional functionality.

  - `ip addr`: Like `ipconfig` on Windows. This is a replacement for
    the `ifconfig` command which is now considered obsolete.

  - `ss`: Displays various network statistics. This is a replacement
    for `netstat`.

  - `ip route show`: Displays the routing table, which also contains the
    gateway.

  - `cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver`: Determines the DNS server and
    outputs it to the console.
