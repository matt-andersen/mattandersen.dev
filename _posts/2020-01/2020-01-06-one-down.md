The first course, _DevOps Essentials_, is down! To view my
progress, [click here]({% post_url

scroll down.

There are two things that keep coming up that I haven't scheduled any courses
for, these being containers and monitoring. I will keep these in the back of
mind for now but will consider adding some work on them in the future. In that
regard, I
think [this link](https://xebialabs.com/periodic-table-of-devops-tools/) will
come in handy.

From the DevOps Essentials course, I learnt about the differences between IaaS
vs PaaS. Which is displayed
in [this handy graphic](/assets/images/cloud-type-stacks.png) (via BMC). I was
familiar with these terms in an abstract sense but couldn't quantify the
technical differences between the two. I also learnt an acronym I had never come
across before, FaaS (Function as a Service), which describes tools like AWS
Lambda and Google Cloud Functions.

I am now onto the git course. My experience with git is using it via GUI-based
software to perform simple functions e.g. commit, push, pull. I only did a bit
of command-line work via an online course I did when I first started learning
git in my first year of uni. From my lessons today, an interesting command I
have never come across before is `git rm --cached`, which removes files from Git
without deleting them from the working directory.
