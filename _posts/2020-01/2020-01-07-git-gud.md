Today I am back on Linux Academy. I finished all the videos in the _Source
Control with Git_ course, minus the GitLab section. I am out of free credits to
take the labs, but I will return to them when I get my Linux Academy
subscription. Below are some useful commands I learnt from today:

- `git tag`: Used to label points in a repository's history which are considered
  important. It's typically used to signify releases.

- `git rebase`: This was a big one for me, I've heard of rebase before but didn'
  t know what it
  meant. [This article](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)
  via Atlassian outlines the differences between merge and rebase very well.

- `git revert HEAD`: This will undo the last commit that was created. It doesn't
  go back in time per se but creates a new commit with information from the
  previous commit. Suffixing the command with a tilde (~) and a number,
  specifies how far back in the commit history to go. For
  example, `git revert HEAD~2` would go back 2 commits.

- `git diff`: Shows the difference between two points in the git commit history.
  A summarised version of this can be achieved using the `--summary` option.

- `git gc`: This refers to git's garbage collection. This is responsible for
  removing objects from the database which can no longer be accessed. Git does
  its own garbage collection after a while, so I don't think this is something
  I'll use often but it's still worth noting.

- `git log`: I thought this was very powerful. The `--graph` option shows the
  git history in a nice visual format. The `--since` option shows the git
  history since a period of time, for example `git log --since="2 hours ago"`.
  The `-S` option allows you to search via a phrase in the history of commit
  messages.

After this course I feel more confident working with git in the command line.
Also, certain terminology like rebase, stash, and HEAD now makes more sense. For
developing this blog, I am now going to use git in the command line and use a
separate branch for development work.
