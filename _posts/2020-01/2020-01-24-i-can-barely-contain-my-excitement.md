Today's focus was on containers. Initially, I started on the _Learn Docker by
Doing_ course in accordance with Linux Academy's _Junior DevOps Engineer_
learning path. But it was suggested that I take _Docker Quick Start_ and \_Docker

- Deep Dive\_ as prerequisites. So, I have updated the pinned post in accordance
  with this. See below for related notes:

- `docker image ls`: View all images that have been installed.

- `docker container ls`: View current running containers.

- `docker contain ls -a`: View previously running containers.

- `docker attach <container name>`: Connect to running container.

- `docker container prune`: Remove all stopped containers.
