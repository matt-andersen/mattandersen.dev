I've skimmed through 60% of the _Introduction to Python_ course, which mainly focuses on basic programming concepts. But the remainder of the course revolves around web development. So, I would like to come back to it at a later date, but for the time being I'd rather focus more so on technologies I am not familiar with.

The focus of this post will revolve around Ansible. Specifically, content covered in Linux Academy's _Ansible Quick Start_ course.

- `ssh-copy-id <hostname>`: Copies public key from your current user to the hostname. This allows you to ssh without typing a password each time.

- `ansible-doc <module name>`: Shows documentation for modules within the terminal.

- `ansible <hostname> -m setup`: Prints setup information of the supplied hostname. Useful for determining whether you have set up the host properly.

- `ansible <hostname> -m ping`: Pings the supplied hostname.

- `ansible <hostname> -b -m yum -a "name=<package name> state=latest"`: Uses yum to install a package on the provided host. Note that the `-b` flag runs the command with elevated privilege, which is necessary when installing software.

- [An example default playbook that would install git to a host](/assets/images/ansible-example.png).

- `ansible-playbook -i <inventory> <playbook>`: Runs a playbook on a specified inventory.
