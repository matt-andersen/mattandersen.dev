I finally sorted out my subscription for Linux Academy, so I went back and
finished up _Source Control with Git_. Which means another course ticked off my
list.

As mentioned yesterday, I have reshaped the direction of my learning. I have
decided to replace my previous course list with
the [Junior DevOps Learning Path](https://linuxacademy.com/learning-path/junior-devops-engineer-entry-level/)
provided by Linux Academy. This will give me some needed structure for my
learning.
The [LPI Linux Essentials Certification](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/346)
course is recommended before taking this learning path. So, this is the course I
started on today. Below are a few notes:

- `ls -a` or `ls --all`: Allows you to see all files in a directory, even hidden
  files. Hidden files in Linux are denoted by a dot (such as .gitignore).

- `ls -l`: Refers to the 'long listing'. Includes file ownership and
  permissions.

- `ls -s`: Shows file size information.

- `ls -h`: Provides size in a human readable format. For example, it shows 4
  kilobytes as 4K instead of 4096. Must be used in conjunction with the `-s`
  option to work, such as `ls -sh`.

- `ll`: An alias for `ls -l`. Varies per each Linux distribution.

- `$PS1`: Refers to the primary prompt string. The prompt refers to the string
  in the shell prior to the cursor, for example `[matt@localhost ~]$`. The \$PS1
  variable is the format of this string. An example format is `[\u@\h \W]\$`
  where each of those characters pertains to a value in the string above.

- Variables can be used to store the output from certain commands. If a variable
  such as `var1=$(ls)` is set. Every time `echo $var1` is executed, the `ls`
  command will be run and files in the directory will be displayed in the
  terminal.

- Quoting:

  - Escape character (\\\): will preserve the value of the _next following_
    character.

  - Single quotes: will preserve the literal value of _every_ character
    contained within the quotes. Including the escape character.

  - Double quotes: will preserve the value of _most_ characters except for \$,
    single quotes, and the escape character.
