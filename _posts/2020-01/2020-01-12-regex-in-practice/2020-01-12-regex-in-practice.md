Much like yesterday, this was a fairly quick session. The weekends seem to get
away from me and I need to get better at managing my time if I want to progress
through these courses. Today I worked through the practicals for _3.2. Searching
and Extracting Data from Files_.

- `ls <directory> | wc -l`: The `ls` command outputs the files and folders
  within a given directory into the pipe (`|`). From the pipe, we can count the
  number of files with `wc` and the `-l` option (which prints the newline
  counts) to determine the amount of files/folders in the directory.

- `cat <file> | grep <phrase> | wc -l`: Used to determine how often a given
  phrase appears in a file. The `grep` command searches for the phrase and pipes
  it into the `wc -l` command to count how many times it appears.

- `cat <file> | grep -E "^<character>" | wc -l`: Counts how many words begin
  with a certain character in a given file. the `-E` option after the `grep`
  command denotes that the pattern following will be regex. The carat symbol (^)
  matches the start of the string with the given character.

- `cat <file> | grep -E "^<character 1>...<character 2>$"`: Used to search for a
  word that begins with character 1, ends with character 2, and is 5 characters
  long in total. The "5 characters in total" is specified by the three dots plus
  the two other character expressions.

- `cat <file> | grep -E "^<character 1>..$|^<character 2>..$" | wc -l`: Used to
  count how many three letter words start with character 1 OR character 2. It is
  important to note that the 'pipe' symbol within the regex is an OR operator.
