I managed to complete the _AWS Concepts_ course today. This was basically a
crash course, but it still allowed me to get a nice overview of what AWS offers.
Below are a few notes from today:

- VPC: Virtual Private Cloud. In my time on the service desk, VPC referred to a
  virtual computer e.g. a VMware Horizon zero client. So initially I assumed
  this is what it meant. But it refers to your own "carved out" section of AWS
  where you can store files and computing resources and allow/restrict certain
  access to them.

- EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud - a computer but on the cloud ðŸ˜²! I've had a bit of
  experience using an EC2 to host a WordPress site. Web hosting seems to be one
  of the more common uses for EC2s.

- RDS: Relational Database Service - a database platform used for storing things
  such as customer account info and as an inventory catalogue.

- S3: Simple Storage Service - storage platform for AWS. Avoid using EC2 for
  long-term storage instead use an S3 bucket.

[This diagram](/assets/images/aws-architecture.png) (via Linux Academy) outlines
how all these pieces could come together.

As a sidenote, I'm restructuring my course outline and will post an update on
that tomorrow.
