I'm still working through the LPI Linux Essentials course. I only had time for
one lesson today. I spent a lot of time just setting up the VirtualBox
environment, which I need to go back and fix due to lack of hard drive space.
Today's focus is on regular expressions (regex).

- `grep -E`: The `-E` option tells grep to interpret the patterns as extended
  regular expressions.

- A [nice link](https://www.guru99.com/linux-regular-expressions.html) which
  lists regex patterns and includes examples.

Hopefully I can smash through some more content tomorrow. I think in future, at
least 1-2 hours a day is ideal.
