After a long weekend, I am back on the Linux Academy training courses. Wrapping
up _Docker Quick Start_ and starting on _Docker Deep Dive_.

I have set up a server hosted on Linux Academy and I am ssh-ing into it. This
will allow me to keep a consistent environment regardless of what computer I am
using. I also wrote
a [Bash script](https://github.com/matt-andersen/handy-scripts) that automates
the setup of a new (Fedora) VPC.

- `docker volume create <volume name>`: Creates a volume. Volumes can be used to
  persist data outside of the container lifecycle.

There weren't many notes for today. The _Docker Deep Dive_ course moved pretty
fast and I was more concerned with trying to keep up with the examples as
opposed to jotting down notes.
