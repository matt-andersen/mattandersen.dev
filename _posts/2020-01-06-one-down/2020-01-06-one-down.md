The first course, _DevOps Essentials_, is down! To view my progress, [click here]({% post_url 2020-01-05-purpose-of-this-blog/2020-01-05-purpose-of-this-blog %}) and scroll down.

There are two things that keep coming up that I haven't scheduled any courses for, these being containers and monitoring. I will keep these in the back of mind for now but will consider adding some work on them in the future. In that regard, I think [this link](https://xebialabs.com/periodic-table-of-devops-tools/) will come in handy.

From the DevOps Essentials course, I learnt about the differences between IaaS vs PaaS. Which is displayed in [this handy graphic](/assets/images/cloud-type-stacks.png) (via BMC). I was familiar with these terms in an abstract sense but couldn't quantify the technical differences between the two. I also learnt an acronym I had never come across before, FaaS (Function as a Service), which describes tools like AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions.

I am now onto the git course. My experience with git is using it via GUI-based software to perform simple functions e.g. commit, push, pull. I only did a bit of command-line work via an online course I did when I first started learning git in my first year of uni. From my lessons today, an interesting command I have never come across before is `git rm --cached`, which removes files from Git without deleting them from the working directory.
