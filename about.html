  <h1 class="heading-text">Hi, I'm Matt 👋</h1>
  <p>I’m a junior software developer with a keen interest in learning and utilising an array of technologies to solve problems.</p>

  <p>
    I have had an obsession with technology for almost as long as I can remember. I started tinkering with (and breaking!) my family computer when I was six
    years old. I taught myself Adobe Photoshop via a textbook my Dad had when I was twelve. And I developed my first website when I was fifteen. With this
    behind me, it became pretty obvious where my future career would lie.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2016, I started my Bachelor of Information Technology at James Cook University, Townsville. In 2019, I graduated with distinction and a final GPA of 6.83
    out of 7. Through my time at university, I was lucky enough to have had several key experiences that shaped who I am now as a technology professional.

  <p>
    In 2017, I was offered an IS&T Service Desk position at Glencore, supporting thousands of users across operations in Mount Isa, McArthur River, Cloncurry,
    Townsville, and Brisbane. This role taught me the importance of how to work fast and think on your feet. As well as how to communicate technical terms to
    people who have a varying range of technical expertise.

  <p>
    In 2018, I was given an opportunity to teach a first year Python programming subject at JCU. Being a first-year subject with no prerequisites, this subject
    is taken by a number of students who come from a range of different faculties. Such as business, marine biology, and education. In addition to this, it's
    one thing to be able to understand how a for loop or an if statement works, but trying to explain it to a room full of students staring up at you is
    something else! This opportunity taught me how to cater my language to explain difficult concepts to a diverse audience.

    When I am not at my computer with twenty tabs open trying to get my head around something tech-related. You can find me hitting the gym, learning about
    finance, playing strategy games, or in the kitchen perfecting my pulled pork and Buffalo wing recipes. If you want to have a chat (or have any craft
    beer recommendations 😁) feel free to contact me via <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email</a> or
